# VR Breathing
VR Breathing is a virtual reality application that has different objects that the user can interact with using their breath. This application produces an alternative way to visualize one's breath as it is in a safe virtual controlled environment so the user will not get harmed with these objects. In addition, the user can utilize the tool to learn more about their breathing patterns with different senses because one cannot directly see their breaths as they are invisible.

## Motivation
The main goal of this project was to design a program that allows the user to improve their breathing performance by observing their breathing habits through the use of the sense of sight. The goal was to have this application be a tool for people with breathing issues to work on their breathing habits.
